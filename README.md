# Innovate Albania Offical Git Repository
A repository of Albanian made projects and Albanian Software Developers

# Offical Discord Server
I'm making this post to let everyone know about our discord server for Albanians interested in business, tech, science, nursing, the arts, and more. We want it to be a server for Albanians to connect, share information about Albania, and learn. Most people speak English or Albanian on the server. Also if you know anyone that would think the server is cool please let them know!

Some of the things we focus on are stocks & crypto, web development, math, law, electronics, economics, entrepreneurship, business news, etc. It's also always growing so it would be awesome to have you add more, and share your knowledge and passions with others.

We're mostly a server for Albanians trying to learn. We have people that are in programs or working in fields that can help set you on the right path in your studies. We also want improve and grow it as well so feel free to leave any feedback or ideas! Also if you have any ideas for some kind of open source project let us know.

Welcome in advance!
